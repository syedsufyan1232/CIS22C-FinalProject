Stephen~Boyd~Engineering
5~4~0~11/29/2012~Super awesome professor. Is able to given intuitive interpretations to very complicated mathematical concepts. Gives good explanation of the theory, and focuses on how to apply it to real world problems. I feel priveledged to have been able to take this course from this professor.
3~4~0~11/11/2012~Very crisp material and delivery. Very impressive personality and knowledge of the subject.
4~2~0~10/09/2012~Extremely application oriented classes. First time I thought learning linear algebra is going to be useful. Brings in a variety of applications. Home works go well in helping understand the concepts. They are realistic and complete with matlab programs we have to write and observe. Best prof in EE!
3~3~0~03/28/2011~A lot of reviews have mentioned that Boyd is full of himself--I don't get that impression at all. He does like to rag on other fields, but most of his criticism is warranted. He has a slightly cheesy sense of humor, knows the subject well, and tries to keep the lectures entertaining. HWs are long but not bad if you're a math person.
2~5~1~02/23/2008~Always elaborate on the really easy points, and skip the difficult ones that most need explaining. Rather read lecture notes than going to lectures.

Clark~Bray~Mathematics
5~4~0~01/19/2007~Best math professor I have had. Very clear and concise in his explanations. Very helpful, down to earth guy. Gave me skiing tips.
1~5~1~10/18/2004~With his incorrect logic and judgments as the guide, students can only be swallowed into the infinite swirl of confusion!
5~4~0~12/09/2003~Clark Bray is an extraordinary instructor. He is competent, enthusiastic, and he emphasizes theory and conceptual understanding of material.
3~5~0~11/02/2003~Imagine having to teach a lecture on something. You decide to teach it backwards and make it as complicated as possible, and then finally at the end of 50 minutes you say something that makes sense. You are Clark Bray.
5~4~0~08/15/2003~great prof. best math teacher i've had...fun guy to talk to. kinda has a johnny bravo thing going on. but a cool guy. highly reccomended.

Kurt~Carrasquilla~Business
5~3~0~08/12/2016~Kurt is an effective, engaging, and knowledgeable teacher. Through him I gained a very good general understanding of wealth management. In each class he incorporates his professional experience, which makes the subject matter easier to learn. I can confidently recommended him to any student who wants to learn about wealth management.
5~3~0~08/05/2016~Excellent class. Professor Carrasquilla was very engaging. I learned a lot and would strongly recommend him to anyone wishing to expand their knowledge in Wealth Management.
5~2~0~07/30/2016~I thoroughly enjoyed professor Carrasquilla's class! He has a ton of experience in personal financial planning/wealth management and was able to transfer that in an easy-to-understand format in the matter of 5 weeks. He covered the most important aspects of financial planning and painted some really important big pictures.
5~3~0~07/29/2016~Kurt was a great professor. He was always there for any questions his students had before or after class. His lectures were both insightful and lively. I would definitely recommend this course to family and friends.
5~2~0~07/28/2016~Professor Carrasquilla was great. He was very approachable and often reiterated that he was available outside of class if we had any questions for him. I would definitely recommend this class and am certainly glad I took it!

Mike~Tomz~Political Science
5~3~0~10/15/2010~Awesome teacher. When I first took this class, I thought I would be turned off from IR. How wrong I was. Besides that he's an influential guy in the field, he's extremely clear and helpful. The tests are hard and you have to do a lot of work, but it's worth it.
3~5~1~03/11/2009~tests too hard. class too strict. turned me off from IR, and i'm an IR major.
5~2~0~12/13/2006~Excellent class; its painful during the process but it provides a foundation for any PoliSci class you'll take after it.
3~3~1~02/22/2006~Arrogant weasel, writes 'gotcha' exams (relevance of Annie Oakley to international relations; if she'd accidentally shot some German politician, WWI might not have happened.... Is this really something that should be on a test;), uses and abuses his research assistant gophers.
5~2~0~01/10/2006~Very clear, structured, nice and easy going

Scott~Bukatman~Film
4~2~0~08/10/2009~scott is the best teacher i have ever had in my entire life and i seriously regret not majoring in film or taking more than 1 class with him
5~4~0~04/03/2009~Great energy & enthusiasm for film. Valuable industry & analysis insights. Terrific sense of humor - but not a goofball, made learning fun. I want to study more about film after taking his class
4~3~0~11/25/2007~Engaging, dynamic lecturer. Smart. Witty. Bit immature, but its endearing. Approachable.
2~3~1~03/09/2004~Funny guy, but not always clear in his purpose.
5~3~0~04/12/2006~scott is a really amazing and engaging prof

Ruth~Starkman~Biomedical
5~4~0~01/20/2017~Energetic lectures on tech and ethics, clearly loves her subject. But be prepared. She'll walk up to you and ask a question about Kant or code or ?? Starkman is the OG.
5~2~0~12/08/2016~BEST PROFESSOR EVER
5~5~0~07/13/2016~Professor Starkman is a little intimdating. She's very welcoming in class and encouraging. Then she rips your work to shreds. Literally. Every. Word. But then she shows you how to improve and she makes you want to do better. In the end you do OK, make friends in class, and learn a lot.
5~5~0~07/27/2015~The stuff I learned with Professor Starkman has stayed with me for years, and when you go back to visit she remembers you perfectly like no time has gone by. Ask her for help on job apps and gradmed school, nobody goes the extra mile like she does.
5~4~0~04/23/2014~She rocks! Ruth helped me on all aspects of my work, from the writing to the ethics and integrating course readings. She totally kills it as an editor for all your school, professional and entrepreneurial writing too.

Ian~Morris~Classics
5~1~0~03/24/2015~Morris is awesome. Take this class you'll love it.
5~3~0~03/16/2009~an Amazing Professor! Certainly the best professor I ever had.
4~3~0~12/17/2006~Professor Morris has this amazing way of telling stories about Greek History that makes it extremely engaging. He also does a great job covering important issues. His accent is also cool.
5~3~0~02/09/2006~awesome accent
3~3~0~08/31/2005~Very entertaining and very focused on his work

Marc~Lucianovic~Mathematics
1~5~1~09/02/2016~Assigned reading and homework on Subject X, THEN a lecture on Subject X. Not effective at all.
4~2~0~01/20/2016~Gives off a cool, relaxed sort of Paul Rudd-ish vibe.
5~2~0~02/17/2009~Best Math teacher I have ever had, and one of the best professors I have had at Stanford. He explains things in a way that makes it easy to understand.
4~3~0~11/18/2008~Mark is hilarious. He has some hilarious comments during lectures. I attend mostly for his jokes. Very clear and great teacher overall.
5~4~0~03/13/2008~Funny, interesting, generally awesome! He was really good at explaining stuff, even integrals. 52 didn't seem quite as hard as I thought it was going to. Take him if you can!

Mark~Kelman~Law
3~5~0~01/15/2009~Confusing, but helpful outside of class.
3~4~0~06/18/2008~One of the reasons I went to law school. He is a great synthesizer and plays off the black letter well. While not a danger in the classroom, he comes sometimes close because his desire for objectivity is undercut by the politics. So the message is confusing. A structuralist thinker that makes him a reactionary on race/gender.
2~3~0~03/28/2008~Kelman is a great professor, if you understand his teaching methodology. He assigns readings that present the black-letter law very clearly. He then uses his lectures to provide scholarly elaboration upon the readings. This often makes it a chellenge to understand him. However, he clearly recognizes this and tests mainly on the black-letter law.
2~3~0~05/03/2007~A mixed bag. Kelman is a gifted intellectual-conversant in philosophy and economics, as well as law-with a fertile and analytical mind. Deep, with many interesting ideas and insights. But he also is a poor communicator, using lots of jargon and convoluted sentence structures. Some students connect with him; others become hopelessly lost.
2~5~1~03/27/2004~Has no idea or has forgotten what it is like to be learning this stuff for the first time.

Benoit~Monin~Psychology
4~4~0~03/01/2008~Creative slides and follows the lecture outline
3~2~0~06/01/2005~GREAT GUY
1~4~1~01/20/2005~Not very clear teaching
4~4~0~02/17/2003~Great French accent - enthusiastic about material
5~1~0~11/30/2004~Really takes an interest in students

Steve~Block~Biology
2~4~1~08/20/2015~Prof Block is brilliant and very clear, but lacks empathy and a moral core. He seems driven to act in a way that is best described as evil. Stay out of this man's orbit.
4~3~0~03/23/2013~I'm not fond of this rating system; although Block wasn't necessarily "crystal clear" or "extremely helpful," he was still awesome! He was so enthusiastic about the subject and thrilled with teaching it to us! I don't know how he would be with more dry material (we studied Mythbusters and the scientific process), but he was great for this class.
5~3~0~08/25/2006~a nice guy, expects alot, just make sure you've thought about your question seriously before you go asking for help.
1~5~1~04/10/2016~Um, no.
2~5~1~10/06/2004~Evil. Very harsh and demoralizing.

Mehran~Sahami~Computer Science
5~3~0~03/08/2017~Awesome lectures can't explain with words
4~4~0~02/06/2017~Wow! such a clear, brilliant teacher. Every class makes you love the material as much as he does.
5~3~0~01/20/2017~Having seen the 106a lectures online and liked them, I wasn't particularly expecting anything new. yeah some of the material was familiar but Mehran was so much more awesome in person and such a great teacher, who really prepared me for some of the more difficult computing concepts.
5~2~0~12/21/2016~One of my fav profs of all time. Textbook needed if you don't have any CS or Java experience but otherwise the class is generally pretty easy. Lectures are recorded.
4~4~0~03/22/2016~He shoves a bunch of html, Javascript, CSS, PHP, and forces down intensive computer knowledge down your throat. He spits sizzling apple juice from his puckered lips and does yoga throughout class.

Giovanni~Tempesta~Language
5~1~0~04/10/2014~Great professor - very knowledgeable and enthusiastic.
5~2~0~03/05/2014~The way he explains each and every concept is excellent.
5~2~0~03/05/2014~Prof Tempesta is one of the best professors I have ever had. He explains everything very well, makes learning fun, and is also super helpful. If you have him you are lucky!
5~2~0~01/11/2014~Professore Tempesta is an amazing teacher, incredibly kind and patient. His enthusiasm for the Italian language and culture made me look forward to coming to class everyday!
5~2~0~09/06/2007~He is an amazing professor, I have taken three quarters of italian from him and I absolutely love him!!

Ewart~Thomas~Psychology
1~4~1~10/21/2016~Super unclear lecturer and even more unclear assignments.
5~3~0~10/03/2016~I learn a lot in class.
2~2~0~03/13/2007~good winter quarter class. no final or midterm
5~2~0~12/01/2006~Prof Thomas is one of the best professors I have had at Stanford. If you apply yourself *a little*, you will lean a *whole lot* from him. What I like most about his classes, both the undergrad and the grad, is that you learn how to practically apply the skills that you learn.
4~2~0~08/25/2006~Don't buy the book. His handouts are awesome and quite legendary. He makes things simple and easy to understand. :) Definately take stats with this guy no matter what!

Michael~Boskin~Economics
4~3~0~06/18/2009~He knows what he's talking about...think Bush's economic policy advisor, but his Econ1B class is pretty boring. He's a nice guy, though, and loves talking to students.
4~2~0~03/16/2009~Public Finance, this guy is awesome
4~1~0~10/27/2008~Professor Boskin is very knowledgeable about public finance. He tells many interesting anecdotes about his work in government. He lecture style is very clear. He also invites every student to have lunch with him once the semester. One negative thing about his class is that it is quite easy and light on math....
5~3~0~09/28/2005~Excellent class, interesting subject matter. Brought the subject to life with videos and examples.
4~3~0~07/15/2005~I really liked Boskin... He was conservative, but it was a nice change. He knows his stuff, has interesting stories, and seemed excited about teaching.

Lanier~Anderson~Philosophy
5~3~0~02/11/2016~One of the best profs at Stanford. Clear, great lectures, very inspirational
5~5~0~05/05/2011~Best professor I ever had at Stanford. His class on existentialism changed my life.
5~4~0~03/23/2007~Lanier Anderson is the most obviously brilliant person I've ever met, and likely the best professor as well. He clearly puts a lot of effort into writing and rehearsing his lectures, and it pays off; they are fascinating. I am stunned that there are people who don't recognize how amazing this guy is.
5~3~0~03/11/2006~lanier has this awesome way of knowing your name and referring to your point and how it fits into the discussion
4~3~0~03/01/2006~Insightful, eloquent, wonderful at engaging a great discussion

Robert~Plummer~Computer Science
4~2~0~12/03/2010~He's clear, enthusiastic and super likeable. I loved his course.
5~4~0~09/23/2009~One of the best classes I took at Stanford. Bob was a great!
5~1~0~03/06/2009~Great professor, extremely clear in presentation and very likable in person. However, it wouldn't hurt if he made his students break a sweat once in a while -- his classes are too easy.
2~4~1~02/15/2008~I learned nothing from him. He went through a problem, explaining each step in clear detail & the reason behind each step so I remembered them, until getting to the final
4~3~0~05/03/2003~lummer is awesome, and his slides are so clear and concise.

Vadim~Khayms~Engineering
4~3~0~09/09/2016~Hilarious guy with dry Russian wit, but also fair and caring. Decent lecturer with very good course readers (no note-taking!). Do your own reading in textbook and course reader or you won't be able to work the HW problems. The CME 104 text (Greenberg) is excellent and covers CME 100/102/104 material; buy it before CME 100 and thank me later.
4~3~0~01/26/2014~Definitely in my top three for teachers at Stanford. Pretty hilarious and his accent makes everything a bit more fun. Very willing to explain and the textbooks he writes are much better than standard published ones. Very strong emphasis on actual use in industry, which makes his problem sets feel a lot more relevant. CME 104 was ridiculously hard
4~5~0~11/11/2011~He likes to make jokes, and he often completely changes the problem when explaining it so students are forced to think outside the box.
3~5~1~02/02/2011~Funny professor but difficult class. Be prepared to devote at least 8 hrs a week to one problem set
5~2~0~12/25/2010~Funny. Humor is a bit on the dry side, but it's quirky good. Lectures are really really helpful. Really willing to stay after and answer your questions. Makes psets hard but tests easier. AMAZING at teaching a concept, really receptive towards you interrupting and answering questions. Definitely taking him for future classes.

Carolyn~Ross~English
2~3~1~05/02/2016~She's so unorganized. She didn't give us any grades, until the end of the quarter when you suddenly get a grade with no explanation. She only gave feedback on one of the four projects for the class ( and even that didn't get a grade).
1~1~1~12/12/2011~This class tried to incorporate both the CWP and CCR formats. This wasted a ton of time and Ms. Ross was herself very disorganized. She never evaluated anyone's work, nor provided any feedback, she simply provided a grade at the end of the quarter. Avoid taking a class from her at all costs. Avoid CWPs at all costs, for fear of getting a dud!
1~5~1~01/20/2009~so frustratingly bad- horrible time management- blabs on and on
5~4~0~10/29/2004~Carolyn Ross is the most amazing writing teacher. She definitely made me look at community service in a whole new way- the topic of her writing course became an object of analysis in its own right. I can actually say her class changed my life!
1~5~1~03/09/2005~Don't ever take a class from this woman. Straight up.

Russell~Berman~Literature
5~2~0~12/10/2016~Professor Berman is profound, caring and helpful, best feedback of any professor I've had.
5~1~0~06/26/2015~Wonderful professor and mentor. Very low-key, but consistently supportive and helpful. He's a bit of a tough conversation though, both in class and out. He makes you do the talking, so be prepared to do that!
5~1~0~08/11/2010~LOVE HIM, so cool, calm and helpful, best ever!
4~1~0~04/18/2010~Easy, nice helpful if you go out of your way to ask for help.
4~1~0~05/18/2009~Nobody else shows up at all the department events and talks to students. True sometimes he can be a grumpy old walrus, but if you ask him for help he can be great. He's not hard on grades and will edit your stuff pretty well if you ASK!

Chris~Chidsey~Chemistry
3~3~0~08/28/2008~There are people who absolutely disliked him. He is definitely not the easiest or most crystal clear, but he has a talent to stimulate critical thinking that is rare in introductory chemistry. I really enjoyed that part, but more disliked him precisingly because the class is too creative - meaning the exams can get hard. Don't just memorize
2~5~1~03/13/2007~Chidsey likes to get creative with his tests, and while lectures are in some way connected to his lectures, for the most part the lectures are irrelevant and writing notes just wastes paper. Going to section for the class and doing the Problem sets is probably helps most, but the class is still tough.
4~3~0~01/23/2007~good professor who explains concepts clearly. The nerdy sense of humor bit mentioned earlier is true, and sometimes makes for amusing lectures.
2~5~1~11/15/2006~Like what was said before, he proves equations you don't need for the test, but he's a very nice guy, but it seems as though he think everyone is a chem genius who knows every equation off the top of their head. Take Chem 31x if you can. It'll be easier.
3~4~0~09/06/2006~Chidsey is a nice guy, kinda nerdy but funny, who knows his stuff and generally presents it well. But sometimes he gets ahead of himself and proves equations you don't really need to know about and that don't help on tests. Willing to stay late after class to help you.

Jack~Rakove~History
1~5~1~01/09/2017~Impossible to understand during lecture
1~5~1~01/09/2017~By far the meanest professor, I have ever had at this university. He was also unhelpful during office hours.
1~5~1~09/23/2016~Could care less about his students, and mean during office hours
1~5~1~07/02/2016~This man is incoherent, mean-spirited, and does not care if his students learn anything. Any student thinking about taking his courses needs to consider other options
1~5~1~05/30/2016~Every other word that comes out of this mans mouth is an insult to a racial minority. The only thing worse than Rakoves in-class behavior, is the universitys unwillingness to do anything about it.

Mark~Tendall~Economics
5~1~0~05/11/2016~This guy is a great lecturer; he's very clear. But, he's also quirky. One of the best lecturers I've had at Stanford, up there with Scott McKeon
2~1~1~06/12/2009~Prof. Tendall teaches you the mathematical steps to solve very specific types of problems. Of course, no one actually learns what anything means, but at least you can get a good grade without understanding hard concepts!
3~2~1~05/18/2009~Mark is a nice guy and is clearer than many professors, but his teaching style is terrible. Rather than helping students understand concepts, he focuses on simple computational rote learning. If you want a very straightforward class where you don't really learn anything, you will like this class.
4~3~0~01/14/2008~Wonderful Professor. A brilliant academic whose enthusiasm for economics is contagious. He is interesting, funny, and nice. He genuinely cares about his students and their success. I am happy to have taken a class from him.
5~3~0~06/15/2007~Really funny and likes teaching. Exams and problem sets are straightforward.
